This project is a clone of the Travelocity website, built to practice and demonstrate front-end and back-end web development skills. The clone replicates key features of Travelocity, including:

- Homepage Layout with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for browsing travel deals, flight options, and vacation packages.
- Search Functionality to find flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities by various criteria, such as location, dates, and budget.
- Detailed Booking Pages that showcase pricing, availability, and booking options, closely resembling the Travelocity experience.
- Responsive Design for seamless usability across devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- User Authentication for secure account creation, login, and profile management.

This project employs technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and relevant frameworks (React) to mimic real-world functionalities. It serves as an educational resource and a portfolio piece to showcase the ability to recreate complex, real-world web applications.
