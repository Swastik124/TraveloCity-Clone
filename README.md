- Search Functionality to find flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities by various criteria, such as location, dates, and budget.
- Detailed Booking Pages that showcase pricing, availability, and booking options, closely resembling the Travelocity experience.
- Responsive Design for seamless usability across devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- User Authentication for secure account creation, login, and profile management.
